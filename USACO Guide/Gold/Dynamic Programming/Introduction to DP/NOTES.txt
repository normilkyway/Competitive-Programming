What is Dynamic Programming?
    Dynamic Programming is a optimization on basic recursion. (also look at memoization / amortization)

When do we use DP?
    1. Count something, the number of ways
    2. Minimize or maximize a certain value ==> Also like Greedy
    3. Yes/No Questions                     ==> Also like Greedy

 Iteration vs. recursion
    Iteration:
        1. Speed
        2. Easier Complexity
        3. Shorter Code
        4. Harder Techniques
            ie. Like Prefix Sums or Segment trees
    Recursion:
        1. Easier application (naive or backtracking + memoization)
        2. Fewer states
        3. Order doesn't matter
